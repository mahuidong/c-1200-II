        That way, you have to create and maintain only as many objects in memory as there are concurrent calls, 
        not as many objects as there are outstanding clients. Between calls, 
        the client holds a reference on a proxy that doesn't have an actual object at the end of the wire. 
        The obvious benefit is that you can now dispose of the expensive resources the service instance occupies long before the client disposes of the proxy. 
        By that same token, acquiring the resources is postponed until they are actually needed by a client. 
        The second benefit is that forcing the service instance to reallocate or connect to its resources on every call caters very well to 
        transactional resources and transactional programming because it eases the task of enforcing consistency with the instance state.";
