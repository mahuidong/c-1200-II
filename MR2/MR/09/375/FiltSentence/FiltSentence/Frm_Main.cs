    progress from the client to the service. That way, you have to create and maintain only as many 
    objects in memory as there are concurrent calls, not as many objects as there are outstanding 
    clients. Between calls, the client holds a reference on a proxy that doesn't have an actual object 
    at the end of the wire. The obvious benefit is that you can now dispose of the expensive resources 
    the service instance occupies long before the client disposes of the proxy. By that same token, 
    acquiring the resources is postponed until they are actually needed by a client. The second benefit 
    is that forcing the service instance to reallocate or connect to its resources on every call caters 
    very well to transactional resources and transactional programming because it eases the task of 
    enforcing consistency with the instance state.";
